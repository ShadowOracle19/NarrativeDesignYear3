        work. I am head archivist of the enigma house Alexis Bright, I will be making

        keep my research secure. \n\nWell then let's get started, shall we\u2026I
        say we but it is just me in here talking to this tape recorder. Regardless
        the agents at the Enigma house have brought in an anomalous object that looks
        like a small three-key lock. \rNothing out of the ordinary right? But whenever
        it is affixed to an object such as a door or container it grows to fit around
        it. The lock is then unable to be destroyed and opened by a lockpick. It
        also seems to imbue this same effect on whatever it is affixed to.\n\nI wonder
        if I can get approval to add this to the door of the archive\n\r\nFor now
        I will be assigning the three keys primary colors so I can keep track of
        them\n\r\nI will ask the higher-ups tomorrow. End recording\n\n\r\nAdditional
        recording to tape 001 for anomalous object 1051. It appears I will need to
        keep multiple keys of different colors along with the ones that lock and
        unlock 1051. I have been finding the keys in different spots has someone
        been entering the archive\u2026 I should hide the tapes as well\n\r\nW..who\u2019s

        - Finally found the statement it looks like the enigma house is trying to
          create and control anomalies.
        - Within statement 032223 this stems from a complaint raised against the
          facility where agents
        - were illegally entering private property of one Henry James.
        - 'Three days later Henry James made this statement about multiple anomalous
          objects appearing around his house '
        - but once brought into the enigma house by the agents they have since gone
          silent.
        - This cannot be a coincidence can it?
        - Since the Malus Liber is with the higherups I need to find out where they
          are keeping it
        - something is telling me I should not let them keep it
        - "Well it's late enough as it is I should lock up now where are the keys\u2026"
        - End Recording
        - Additional Recording
        - Someone has been entering the archives many of the anomalies are missing
          I have since added more keys to hopefully throw whoever it is off
        - I also found out where they are keeping the Malus Liber I have to get it
          tonight or risk them moving it elsewhere
        - it is in the office of the head of the enigma house.
        - "I will add an additional if I can find it\u2026or if I get caught well
          we will see."
        - End Recording
        - I got the book and wow there are so many more entries.
        - ' It''s nothing uniform though it looks like they are trying to find or
          create something'
        - I need to hide this before the higher-ups find out it's gone
        - "I also need to hide to finish my research I should digitize everything
          so I can spread it on the internet\u2026"

        and a pen to write what happened so I guess here we go. My name is Jimmy
        Kenney and I am here to I guess write about my experience with the cube monster
        thing. Well it all started about a week ago I met this guy at a bar who wore
        a suit and tie and had a weird villain mustache should have been a red flag
        but regardless I soon came to learn his name is Cassious Phillipe (Facility
        note the name is Cassius Philippe) I hope I spelt that correctly well after
        meeting him I thought he was just some toy salesmen or something like that
        I don\u2019t know I honestly was a bit drunk that night. Regardless he persuaded
        me to buy a cube toy I thought it was like a Rubik's cube but I soon came
        to learn it wasn\u2019t that\u2026I woke up the next morning not expecting
        much heck I forgot I bought that cursed thing. I went through my day not
        to much out of the ordinary some food went missing but I thought my cat Twix
        got into it now that I think about it Twix was acting strange that day he
        was very skittish I soon came to learn why. "
      - "It was quiet before the noises started the horrible crunching I ran to see
        thinking Twix got into something but it was that damn cube it looked like
        it turned into a spider Twix had been calling for help as it was tangled
        in its web. It then jumped and attacked me its sharp claws and fangs I screamed
        the neighbors must have heard because the police came to my door when I was
        hiding from that thing luckily Twix and I are ok just some scratches on me
        and luckily no wounds on Twix just he was scared. Your company soon came
        into my house to remove the cube box thing and cleaned everything up I hope
        you destroy that thing before it hurts anyone\u2026\r"

        I had previously put in a complaint as many of your agents had gone on my
        property without permission or a warrant and just forced me out of my own
        house for 4 hours they left my house an utter mess. That is all in my complaint
        however what I want to talk about is what happened afterwards. It was chaos
        in my house many of my appliances just sprung to life I can\u2019t describe
        what even happened by the time your company got everything out of there I
        had nothing left in my house. I do hope I will be compensated for what happened.
        It was very odd when the chaos was going on it looked like demons had possessed
        everything but once your agents came to my house they seemed to obey and
        acted like soldiers as everything just walked out of my house. Seriously
        bring a meaning to it just grew legs and walked away. I will be in touch
        with lawyers you all better watch out.\r"

      - "Made by: Cassius Philippe\r\n\r\nGood day to whoever will be reading this
        statement my name is Cassius Philippe, and I am a wealthy archeologist who
        discovered the book named the Malus Liber. This is why I have come here to
        talk about I hope the company received and is properly containing the book.
        About 20 years ago in an expedition to a freshly unearthed temple, I found
        the book on an altar surrounded by the skeletons of what I assume were the
        former inhabitants. from carvings on the wall, it looked like an ancient
        cult worshipped this book for its strange properties when I was leaving with
        the book the skeletons sprung to life there is an entry within the book about
        it under the title \u201CThe Guards\u201D. I do wanna add it's strange even
        though this book predates modern English it reads in our language I found
        this is why it translates for whoever is reading it such as non-English speakers
        can read the book in their own languages. My apologies I think I am rambling
        on I should get back to my statement. I usually kept the Malus Liber in storage
        to keep it safe but recently I have been hearing whispers from it calling
        to me and telling me its secrets I soon learned how to use the book to bring
        things to life and that object gained an entry in the book but the more I
        was around the book I began to fall ill I had to get the book to the Engima
        House it should be safe with the higher ups in high security please make
        sure it gets to them. I must take my leave have a good day.\r"
