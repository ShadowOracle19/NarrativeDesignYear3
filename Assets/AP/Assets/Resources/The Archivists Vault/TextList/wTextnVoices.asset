        work. I am head archivist of the enigma house Alexis Bright, I will be making
        these recordings as I much prefer audio, and using this tape recorder will
        keep my research secure. \n\nWell then let's get started, shall we\u2026I
        say we but it is just me in here talking to this tape recorder. Regardless
        the agents at the Enigma house have brought in an anomalous object that looks
        like a small three-key lock. \rNothing out of the ordinary right? But whenever
        it is affixed to an object such as a door or container it grows to fit around
        it. The lock is then unable to be destroyed and opened by a lockpick. It
        also seems to imbue this same effect on whatever it is affixed to.\n\nI wonder
        if I can get approval to add this to the door of the archive\n\r\nFor now
        I will be assigning the three keys primary colors so I can keep track of
        them\n\r\nI will ask the higher-ups tomorrow. End recording\n\n\r\nAdditional
        recording to tape 001 for anomalous object 1051. It appears I will need to
        keep multiple keys of different colors along with the ones that lock and
        unlock 1051. I have been finding the keys in different spots has someone
        been entering the archive\u2026 I should hide the tapes as well\n\r\nW..who\u2019s
        there?\n\r\nI have to get out of here I will continue my research at home\u2026\n\r\nEnd

        They seem to be one of the enigma houses top investors but their name always
        seems to come up within statements.\n\r\nThe higher-ups have told me not
        to look into this as I have brought it up in my reports multiple times.\n\r\nIt
        appears this time Mr. Philippe was selling the anomalous object 344 which
        is here in the vault. Jimmy Kenney is the one to whom Mr. Philippe was selling
        it to but the object is in special storage as it is highly dangerous. So
        how would someone get their hands on it and as well sell it in the first
        place?\n\r\nDid Mr. Philippe know it would cause harm to Mr. Kenney and then
        end up in this facility?\r\n\r\nObject 344 has been inactive since it entered
        the facility as we aren\u2019t able to induce the same effect reported from
        Jimmy Kenney\u2019s statement\n\r\nI do feel like it is watching me though
        I will have to keep my eye on it or maybe put it away for now\r\n\r\nI will
        keep the number of times Cassius Philippe\u2019s name comes up within a notepad
        in my desk\n\r\nEnd Recording\r\n"

        already 3 a.m. Well, let's hope I can get this done.\r\n\r\nSo where was
        I\u2026 Ah yes\r\n\r\nRegarding statement 12987 this one was made by Cassius
        Philippe, regarding his experience with a book named The Malus Liber. There
        are some odd notes in this book written in pen. It references some anomalies
        we have here in the vault all of them had a reference to Mr. Philippe\n\r\nThe
        higher-ups have requested that the Malus Liber be transported to another
        facility but allowed me to study the book for today\r\n\r\nWhile this book
        was in Mr. Philippe\u2019s possession he expressed concern about what he
        described as objects coming to life and gaining weird properties. These objects
        then gained an entry within Malus Liber. Can this book create anomalies?!\n\r\nAlthough
        the more I try to read the book I find the words become more jumbled up.
        Ugh, my head is killing me I should get more coffee\u2026\n\nWell then Alexis
        I will be taking this back the higher-ups are paying a high price for this.
        Hmm?\n\r\nAdditional recording after reviewing tape 035 I did not realize
        it went on longer than I thought. No wonder the book went missing what could
        Cassius or even the higher-ups want with a book that can create anomalies?\n\r\nThere
        may be a statement somewhere here that could lead me in the right direction
        I will record it once I find it\n\r\nEnd Recording\n\n"

        object 2546 or the Malus Liber is a leather-bound book containing a catalog
        of anomalies assumingly all created by the Malus Liber. No matter how many
        pages get filled within the book it never gets full and pages are able to
        appear at will.\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\nMalus Liber is able to create new anomalies
        and reading it for an extended period of time puts a strain on the reader's
        mind usually leading to passing out (Note from Alexis Bright: I read it for
        5 hours before the full effect happened and I passed out but headaches and
        fatigue happened after an hour)\r\nHead Archivist Alexis Bright \r"
