      - "Testing Testing 1 2 3. Ok it seems like I finally got this old thing to
        work. I am head archivist of the enigma house Alexis Bright, I will be making
        these recordings as I much prefer audio, and using this tape recorder will
        keep my research secure. \n\nWell then let's get started, shall we\u2026I
        say we but it is just me in here talking to this tape recorder. Regardless
        the agents at the Enigma house have brought in an anomalous object that looks
        like a small three-key lock. \rNothing out of the ordinary right? But whenever
        it is affixed to an object such as a door or container it grows to fit around
        it. The lock is then unable to be destroyed and opened by a lockpick. It
        also seems to imbue this same effect on whatever it is affixed to.\n\nI wonder
        if I can get approval to add this to the door of the archive\n\r\nFor now
        I will be assigning the three keys primary colors so I can keep track of
        them\n\r\nI will ask the higher-ups tomorrow. End recording\n\n\r\nAdditional
        recording to tape 001 for anomalous object 1051. It appears I will need to
        keep multiple keys of different colors along with the ones that lock and
        unlock 1051. I have been finding the keys in different spots has someone
        been entering the archive\u2026 I should hide the tapes as well\n\r\nW..who\u2019s
        there?\n\r\nI have to get out of here I will continue my research at home\u2026\n\r\nEnd
        Recording\n \r\n"
